<p><b>Peter Pan</b> is a fictional character created by <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Scottish_novelists">Scottish novelist</a> and playwright
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._M._Barrie">J. M. Barrie</a>. A free-spirited and
    mischievous young boy who can fly and never grows up, Peter Pan spends his never-ending childhood having adventures
    on the mythical island of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neverland">Neverland</a> as the leader of the <a

    ordinary children from the world outside Neverland.</p>
<p>Peter Pan has become a cultural icon symbolizing youthful innocence and escapism. In addition to two distinct works
    by Barrie, The Little White Bird (1902, with chapters 13â€“18 published in Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens in 1906),
    and the West End stage play Peter Pan; or, the Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up (1904, which expanded into the 1911 novel
    Peter and Wendy), the character has been featured in a variety of media and merchandise, both adapting and expanding
    on Barrie's works. These include several films, television series and many other works.</p>
